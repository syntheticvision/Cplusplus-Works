This workshop helped me with the understanding of dynamic memory allocation and how to use 
constructors and deconstructors. I worked with creating a class with private and public scope.
creating functions declaration and then building the constructors and deconstructors for the said functions.
This workshop helped me understanding the dynamic memory allocation and deallocation of the functions that we write.
Although it's tricky when comes to implementing the functions while working with pointers and mostly taking into account the dynamic memory
allocation but I understand the concepts better now.
